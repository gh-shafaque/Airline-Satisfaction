# Airline Satisfaction Analysis Project

## Overview

The Airline Satisfaction Analysis project aims to analyze and predict customer satisfaction levels using various machine learning algorithms. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The primary goal is to determine the factors influencing passenger satisfaction and build a model to predict satisfaction levels accurately.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gh-shafaque/Airline-Satisfaction.git
    cd Airline-Satisfaction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found Invistico_Airline.csv.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The preprocessing steps are implemented in the `untitled3.py`.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. The steps are implemented in the `untitled3.py`.

## Modeling

RandomForestClassifier machine learning models are used to predict customer satisfaction.

The modeling process is implemented in the `untitled3.py`.


## Usage

To run the project, execute the `main.py` script:
```bash
python app.py
```
